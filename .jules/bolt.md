## 2026-01-26 - Critical SEO Flaw in AppWrapper
**Learning:** The `AppWrapper` component uses `useState(false)` for `showContent` and only sets it to `true` in `useEffect`, which effectively hides all site content from Server Side Rendering (SSR) and search engine crawlers. The HTML output is empty div until client-side hydration.
**Action:** When auditing "performance", check for SEO-critical rendering patterns. A site that loads fast but has no content for crawlers is performant but useless. In future, check `RootLayout` wrappers for client-side rendering gates.
