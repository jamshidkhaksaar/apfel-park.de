# Product Guidelines: Fixtech

## Tone of Voice
- **Primary:** Formal & Professional ("Sie").
- **Characteristics:** The language should be respectful, authoritative, and trustworthy. It should convey deep expertise in technology and repair, assuring customers of the highest quality service and products.
- **Language:** German (Standard).

## Brand Values
- **Exclusivity & Luxury:** The brand is positioned as a premium destination for technology. Every touchpoint, from browsing to purchase or booking, should feel special, curated, and high-end.
- **Quality Assurance:** While luxurious, the core promise is reliability and top-tier service for valuable devices.

## Visual Identity: Dark Luxury & Glassmorphism
The visual strategy is a refined "polish" of the existing theme, elevating it to a modern, luxurious standard without a complete structural rebuild.

### Core Visual Elements
- **Color Palette:**
    -   **Backgrounds:** Deep blacks and very dark greys (`apfel-black`). Replace all pure white backgrounds with dark tones to maintain immersion.
    -   **Accents:** `apfel-gold` used strategically for buttons, borders, and active states.
    -   **Textures:** Gold textures to be used in the navbar and key header areas to add depth and richness.
- **Glassmorphism:**
    -   Use dark, semi-transparent backgrounds with background blur (backdrop-filter) for overlays, cards, and sticky headers.
    -   Borders should be subtle, perhaps with a faint gold gradient to define edges against the dark background.
- **Effects & Animation:**
    -   **Pulse Gold Effect:** Apply a subtle, pulsating gold glow/shadow around product cards or call-to-action buttons (especially on hover) to draw attention elegantly.
    -   **Smooth Transitions:** Ensure hover states and modal openings are smooth and polished.
- **Imagery:**
    -   **Sliders:** Update main slider images to high-quality assets that strictly adhere to the black/gold theme.
    -   **Product Presentation:** Ensure product images pop against the dark backgrounds.

## Design Execution Guidelines
1.  **Navbar:** Replace standard backgrounds with a gold-textured, potentially glass-morphic dark surface.
2.  **Cards (Products/Services):** Implement glassmorphism on card backgrounds. Add the "pulse gold" effect on hover to create a tactile, interactive feel.
3.  **Content Areas:** Invert any existing light sections to dark. Ensure typography is legible (light grey/white text) on these new dark backgrounds.
4.  **Overall Aesthetic:** The goal is an "appealing modern gold and dark glassmorphism luxury design" that feels cohesive and expensive.
